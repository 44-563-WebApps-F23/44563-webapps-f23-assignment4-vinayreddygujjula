            [The same room. The mist still lies heavy over the landscape.]
            <br>
            [MANDERS and MRS. ALVING enter from the dining-room.]
            <br>
            MRS. ALVING. [Still in the doorway.] _Velbekomme_ [Note: A phrase
            equivalent to the German _Prosit die Mahlzeit_--May good digestion wait
            on appetite.], Mr. Manders. [Turns back towards the dining-room.] Aren't
            you coming too, Oswald?
            <br>
            OSWALD. [From within.] No, thank you. I think I shall go out a little.
            <br>
            MRS. ALVING. Yes, do. The weather seems a little brighter now. [She
            shuts the dining-room door, goes to the hall door, and calls:] Regina!
            <br>
            REGINA. [Outside.] Yes, Mrs. Alving?
            <br>
            MRS. ALVING. Go down to the laundry, and help with the garlands.
            <br>
            REGINA. Yes, Mrs. Alving.
            <br>
            [MRS. ALVING assures herself that REGINA goes; then shuts the door.]
            <br>
            MANDERS. I suppose he cannot overhear us in there?
            <br>
            MRS. ALVING. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.
            <br>
            MANDERS. I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
            morsel of dinner.
            <br>
            MRS. ALVING. [Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.] Nor I.
            But what is to be done now?
            <br>
            MANDERS. Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
            utterly without experience in matters of this sort.
            <br>
            MRS. ALVING. I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.
